CryptoMike Profit Trailer Strategy

What is this? This is my version of Default PT config (which is 2.0.5 CryptoCoyns) but (the most important part):
The market goes up and down. Every strategy ends up with some bags that prevent you from trading those coins, which got stuck in bags. 
BUT! These coins continue go up and down and you miss a chance to ride the waves :)
So what I invented - I send every bought coins to DCA first after it loses 1% of profit and I give the coin a chance to be DCA'ed and sold. If it was not sold or it didn't go to -1, I send it to pending Log.
It gives me another chance to trade the same coin and make profits until it got stuck again.
If it got stuck again - it goes to Pending Log, bot cancels previous order, merge it with the current one, recalculate the average and put another sell order.
Having my bags in pending order rather than in DCA I benefit from this:
1. I can catch the spike. Usually bot doesn't have enough speed to catch the spike, but a sell order has.
2. I'm able to trade the same coin again and make profit
3. I'm still DCAing (in my own manner - via Pending Log) coins, so average goes down

As additional benefit with this strategy you will see more small sales which is good for your mental health and prevent from panic sell :)

I highly recommend not to increase initial cost (it's now 0.0013). Yes, it takes a lot of time to load your free depo, but it gives you HUGE advantage when market will go down (it will, trust me).
